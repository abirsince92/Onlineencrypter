# Onlineencrypter
This web application will encrypt any text using the secured Hashed algorithm like MD5,SHA1,Repmed160 alogorithm.

We know that hashed functions are extremely useful and appear in almost all information security applications like 
password security,password authentications from the atackers.So I think this app will really help anyone for protecting 
any text file/for sending secured message between two sender and receiver.

Pls open the onlineencrypt.php for getting the main file and run this program in XAMPP/WAMP server in localhost.
This program will encrypt any text using some more secured hashed algorithms like MD5,SHA1,SHA2,repmed160 etc.
